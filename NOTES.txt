Modules are imported via compressed pickle files.  The compressed file has the
structure:

module_name.tlz4.blkar
  |
  |--> ./cert
  |     |
  |     |--> <module_name>.cert <-- pki encrypted certificate for this package
  |
  |--> ./data
  |     |
  |     |--> <module_name>.osd  <-- certificate signed OS dependencies (optional)
  |     |--> <module_name>.pcd  <-- certificate signed PCAS dependencies (optional)
  |     |--> <module_name>.ind  <-- certificate signed index of the package
  |     |--> <module_name>.pth  <-- certificate signed install paths
  |     |--> <module_name>.sel  <-- certificate signed SELinux context script
  |
  |--> ./module
        |
        |--> 00.dat             <-- certificate encrypted 4MiB sliced pickle
        |--> 01.dat
        |--> nn.dat

NOTE:  These can be embedded within .deb, .rpm or other packages.
NOTE:  Self-signed certificates are not valid under any circumstances.

When installed will create a folder at $PCAS_ROOT/app/module_name with the
joined contents of module_name.tlz4.blkar(./module/*) with the contents:
$PCAS_ROOT/app/<module_name>/
  |
  |
  |--> assets     <-- multimedia and data assets
  |
  |--> packages   <-- symlinks to apps installed in $PCAS_ROOT/bin
  |
  |--> cert       <-- the certificate(s) from the module package
  |
  |--> docs
  |       |--> <various docs>
  |       |--> LICENSE/COPYING/README,etc
  |
  |--> live       <-- The location of the actual module files


Optionally, a "dev" and "test" folder may be under $PCAS_ROOT.app/<module_name>
if development or testing builds of the module are available on the system.

The certificate will be used for all HTTPS requests served by this Django
module.

NOTE: The default location for $PCAS_ROOT is /opt/pcas on Linux,
    /n/pcas on Plan9.  Plan9 is unsupported.  It's use is currently entirely
    experimental.
